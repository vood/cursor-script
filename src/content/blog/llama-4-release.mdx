<PerformanceChart />

What's particularly impressive is that Llama 4 Maverick achieves results comparable to [DeepSeek V3](https://deepseek.com/) on reasoning and coding benchmarks with less than half the active parameters.

## Training Data and Methodology

While Meta hasn't disclosed the exact composition of their training data, they've shared that Llama 4 models were trained on:

- Several trillion tokens of text data from a diverse range of sources
- Hundreds of millions of image-text pairs for multimodal training
- Video content to improve temporal understanding
- Code repositories to enhance programming capabilities

Meta has stated they implemented rigorous data cleaning processes to reduce potential biases, including:

- Automated detection and filtering of harmful content
- Balancing of perspectives on contentious topics
- Diverse dataset curation across cultures, languages and domains
- Extensive human review of sensitive categories

However, as with all large language models, some biases are likely to remain embedded in the models, and users should implement additional safeguards for sensitive applications. For more on this topic, see Meta's [Responsible AI practices](https://ai.meta.com/responsible-ai/).

## Competitive Positioning

Llama 4 represents Meta's most aggressive move yet in the AI race, positioning itself against the major closed-source models:

### Meta vs. OpenAI

While [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) maintains a performance edge with its [GPT-4.5](https://openai.com/gpt-4) model, the gap is narrowing significantly. OpenAI's advantage lies in its reasoning-focused models like [o1](https://openai.com/research/o1) and o3-mini, which incorporate explicit fact-checking mechanisms. However, Meta's more open licensing and emphasis on efficiency could give it an edge in widespread adoption.

### Meta vs. Anthropic

[Anthropic's Claude models](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) have been noted for their harmlessness and helpful alignment. While [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet) still outperforms Llama 4 Maverick, the gap is small, and Meta's models come without the API cost structure that Anthropic requires.

### Meta vs. Google

Google's [Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) maintains advantages in certain reasoning tasks, but Llama 4 models demonstrate stronger performance in coding and STEM benchmarks. Google maintains tighter control over its models, while Meta's more open approach enables broader experimentation.

### Meta vs. Chinese AI Labs

The rapid advancement of models from Chinese labs like [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.com/) reportedly pushed Meta to accelerate Llama 4 development. While these models have shown impressive capabilities, Meta's broader ecosystem integration and partnership network gives it advantages in global deployment.

## Architectural Innovations

What sets Llama 4 apart is its [Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture](https://ai.meta.com/blog/mixture-of-experts/), which fundamentally changes how these models process information:

<ModelArchitecture />

Instead of activating all parameters for every task, the MoE architecture intelligently selects which "expert" parts to activate based on the specific question or task. This approach delivers more powerful results while using fewer computing resources, making advanced AI more accessible and cost-effective.

    style D3 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style D128 fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

For example, Maverick has 400 billion total parameters but only activates 17 billion parameters across its 128 experts for any given task. This selective activation is what enables these models to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining reasonable computational requirements.

## Multimodal Capabilities

All Llama 4 models were trained on "large amounts of unlabeled text, image, and video data" to give them broad visual understanding. This makes them truly multimodal, capable of processing and reasoning about both text and images together.

These capabilities enable new types of applications:

- [Visual question answering](https://paperswithcode.com/task/visual-question-answering)
- Image-based reasoning
- Document analysis with visual elements
- Code understanding with visual context

## Real-World Applications

Each model in the Llama 4 family excels at different tasks, opening up unique application possibilities:

## Implications for Developers

The release of Llama 4 creates significant new opportunities for developers across various domains:

### Efficiency and Cost Savings

Developers can now build applications with near-flagship performance at significantly lower computational costs. A single H100 GPU can run Llama 4 Scout, enabling sophisticated AI capabilities for smaller companies and individual developers who previously couldn't afford the infrastructure required for top-tier models.

### Multimodal Applications

The native multimodal capabilities eliminate the need for separate vision encoders or complex pipelines to handle images alongside text. This simplifies application architecture and enables more seamless user experiences where people can communicate with AI using whatever format makes the most sense.

### Long-Context Applications

Scout's 10M token context window enables entirely new categories of applications that were previously impossible. Developers can now build systems that understand entire books, codebases, or research papers, maintaining context and making connections across vast amounts of information.

### Custom Fine-tuning

The architecture of Llama 4 models makes them particularly amenable to specialized fine-tuning, allowing developers to adapt them to niche domains while maintaining general capabilities. This opens up possibilities for domain-specific assistants that don't sacrifice breadth of knowledge.

## Limitations and Challenges

Despite their impressive capabilities, Llama 4 models come with several important limitations:

### Hardware Requirements

While more efficient than previous models of similar capability, Llama 4 still requires significant computational resources. Scout needs a full [H100 GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/), while Maverick requires an H100 DGX system or equivalent. This puts the most powerful models out of reach for many smaller organizations.

### Licensing Restrictions

The EU restrictions in the license could significantly limit adoption in European markets, creating fragmentation in the AI ecosystem. The special licensing requirements for large platforms also pose challenges for widespread integration. Read the full [Llama 4 license](https://llama.com/license/) for details.

### Not Reasoning Models

Unlike OpenAI's o1 and o3-mini models, Llama 4 models don't incorporate specific reasoning mechanisms that fact-check their answers. This means they may still be prone to hallucinations or incorrect information in certain scenarios.

### Ethical Considerations

Meta's tuning of the models to "refuse to answer contentious questions less often" raises questions about the balance between helpfulness and potential harm. While this makes the models more responsive, it could also increase risks related to misuse if safeguards aren't robust.

## Availability and Ecosystem

Meta has made Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick available for download on [llama.com](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama), with Behemoth still in training. [Meta AI](https://meta.ai), the company's AI-powered assistant across WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, has been updated to use Llama 4 in 40 countries, though multimodal features are currently limited to the U.S. in English.

### Video Demonstration

The release of Llama 4 represents more than just another model update—it signals a fundamental shift in how AI models are designed and deployed. The MoE architecture points toward a future where AI systems become increasingly modular and specialized, allowing for greater efficiency without sacrificing capability.

As these models become more widely adopted, we can expect to see:

1. **Democratized AI development**: The efficiency gains of the MoE architecture will continue to bring down computational requirements, enabling more developers to work with cutting-edge models.

2. **Specialized expert networks**: Future iterations may allow developers to swap in custom-trained "experts" for specific domains, creating increasingly specialized AI systems that maintain general capabilities.

3. **Multimodal integration**: As multimodal capabilities become standard, the line between different types of content will continue to blur, creating more natural and intuitive human-AI interactions.

4. **Infrastructure evolution**: Cloud providers will likely optimize their offerings specifically for MoE architectures, potentially creating new specialized hardware accelerators designed for this approach.

Meta's commitment to open AI models continues to provide developers, researchers, and businesses with access to cutting-edge technology, fostering innovation in the AI ecosystem. The company plans to share more about its vision at [LlamaCon](https://llamacon.ai) on April 29.

As Meta stated in its [announcement](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/): "These Llama 4 models mark the beginning of a new era for the Llama ecosystem. This is just the beginning for the Llama 4 collection."

Whether you're a developer building applications, an enterprise integrating AI into workflows, or simply curious about the potential of AI, Llama 4 represents a significant step forward in making powerful, multimodal AI more accessible to everyone. As we move forward, the true impact of these models will be measured not by their technical specifications, but by the new possibilities they unlock for human creativity and problem-solving.
