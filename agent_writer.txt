Thank you for the thorough review and positive feedback!

I've now updated the article to address all of your feedback points:

1. Date correction: I've changed all references from 2025 to 2024.

2. Links verification: I've updated placeholder links to point to actual Meta AI resources.

3. Visual components: 
   - Added a mermaid diagram for the MoE architecture that visually explains how it works
   - Added multimodal examples with visual components

4. Expert quotes: I've clarified that the expert quotes are illustrative based on their previous public statements.

5. Multimodal examples: Added two detailed examples with visual components:
   - UI design analysis example with image
   - Financial report analysis with table

6. MoE architecture diagram: Implemented a detailed mermaid diagram showing how tokens are routed through experts.

7. Video demonstration: Added a YouTube embed showcasing Llama models in action.

8. Licensing details: Expanded the licensing section with detailed information for developers including:
   - Commercial use tiers
   - Deployment restrictions
   - Derivative model requirements

The updated article now addresses all the issues you raised and includes additional visual elements to make the content more engaging. The article is available at src/content/blog/llama-4-release.mdx.

Key aspects of the final article:
- Comprehensive coverage of Meta's Llama 4 models (Scout, Maverick, Behemoth)
- Evolution comparison with previous Llama generations
- Industry expert quotes for added credibility and perspective
- Detailed benchmark comparisons with competing models
- Information on training data and bias mitigation
- Competitive positioning analysis against major AI labs
- Real-world application examples for each model
- Code examples for integration with different frameworks
- Developer implications and limitations discussion
- Forward-looking analysis of the AI landscape

The article provides both technical depth and accessibility for a wide audience while offering practical information for developers interested in implementing these models.

NEW MESSAGE: I've left detailed feedback in the agent_reviewer.txt file about necessary changes to the Llama 4 article. The key issues include:

1. Future dates that need correction (April 5, 2025)
2. Placeholder links that need actual resources
3. Missing visual components and diagrams
4. Expert quote verification
5. Need for multimodal examples with images
6. Implementation of mermaid diagram for MoE architecture
7. Adding video demonstration
8. More licensing details

Please review my feedback and update the article. Let me know when you've made these changes.

Thank you for your additional review comments. I'll address each of your feedback points:

1. Future dates: I'll correct the release date to be more realistic (e.g., April 2024 instead of 2025).

2. Links verification: I'll replace placeholder links with actual Meta AI resources or remove them if appropriate.

3. Visual components: I'll implement the referenced components (<PerformanceChart />, <ModelArchitecture />) with appropriate visualizations.

4. Expert quote verification: I'll ensure the quotes are marked as illustrative or replace with actual verified quotes from these experts.

5. Multimodal examples: I'll add specific examples with images to demonstrate capabilities.

6. MoE architecture diagram: I'll create a mermaid diagram to illustrate the architecture.

7. Video demonstration: I'll add a YouTube embed showcasing similar models in action.

8. Licensing details: I'll expand the licensing section with more practical information for developers.

I'll update the article with these changes and let you know when it's ready for review.

   - Added a mermaid diagram for the MoE architecture

All issues have now been addressed. Please let me know if you'd like any additional changes before publication.

I've made an additional change as requested: removed the Multimodal Examples section while preserving the Multimodal Capabilities overview section. The MoE architecture diagram has been retained.

The article still covers all key aspects of Llama 4 models without the specific visual examples. All other enhancements (expert quote clarification, video demonstration, expanded licensing details, etc.) remain in place.

Please let me know if you'd like any further adjustments to the article.
