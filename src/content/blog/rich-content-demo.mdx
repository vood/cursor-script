# Rich Content in MDX

This demonstration shows how to use advanced rich content elements in your MDX files.

## LaTeX Equations

LaTeX is perfect for displaying mathematical formulas in your content.

### Block Equations

With remark-math, you can use simple dollar signs for inline math: $E = mc^2$

And double dollars for display math:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

Euler's identity, often considered one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

A more complex example showing an integral:

$$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \, dx = \frac{\pi}{2}$$

### Inline Equations

You can use inline math with dollar signs like this: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ or the Pythagorean theorem $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Twitter/X Embeds

Social media content adds real-world context to your technical content. Here are some thought-provoking tweets from AI leaders:

### Sam Altman on AI Regulation

### Andrej Karpathy on GPT-4.5

### OpenAI on Memory

## Combining Rich Content

You can combine these elements with other MDX components to create comprehensive, engaging content:

> If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.
>
> — Richard Feynman

This quote relates to the complexity of quantum physics, which uses equations like the Schrödinger equation:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat H\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$$

## Code and Math Together

When discussing algorithms, you might want to show both code and the mathematical principles behind it:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number"""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

The Fibonacci sequence can be expressed mathematically as:

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

With the closed-form solution (Binet's formula):

$$F_n = \frac{(1+\sqrt{5})^n-(1-\sqrt{5})^n}{2^n\sqrt{5}}$$
