## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post! This post is written in **MDX**, which allows you to use JSX components within your Markdown.

Isn't that cool?

## Features

- Use standard Markdown syntax.
- Embed React components.
- Enjoy the power of both worlds!

```javascript
console.log("Hello from MDX!");
```

Stay tuned for more posts!
